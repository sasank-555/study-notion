## 🛠 Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sasank-555/study-notion.git
cd study-notion
npm install
```

## 🚀 Usage

To start the development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and you can view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 💻 Development

During development, you can take advantage of Vite's hot module replacement (HMR) for a fast and smooth development experience. Tailwind CSS is used for styling, and you can customize the styles in the `tailwind.config.js` file.

### 📜 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the project for production.
- `npm run serve`: Serves the production build locally.

## 📦 Build

To create a production build of the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be located in the `dist` directory. You can then serve the files in this directory using any static file server.

## 🛠 Technologies
